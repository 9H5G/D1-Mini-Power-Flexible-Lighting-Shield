# D1-Mini-Power-Flexible-Lighting-Shield

## Here are the specs of the final shield:

	6-24V voltage regulator at up to 3A
	3 pwm channels (up to 2.5A) for controlling RGB led strings
	1 channel with WS2812B ‘driver’
	1 other breakout pin
	Voltage divider on board for battery monitoring and switching
	Stackable! You can use more than one lighting board per D1 Mini
	Serial pins unused should you need to wire to an array of other microcontrollers.
	Configurable.  Only populate the areas you need on the board for the required functionality

## Testing confirms the following:

	Power supply good to 2.5A continuous at 30C
	Drives a string of 120 WS2812B at 80% brightness
	PWM channels (current sink) good for 2.5A per channel
	McLighting, Tasmota compatible
	PWM and WS2812B drivers work separately or concurrently
